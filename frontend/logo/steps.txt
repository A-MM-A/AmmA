What's Included in the SVG:
The full image is embedded for reference.

Named <g> groups for each of the following:

Shapes: top_cone_left, top_cone_middle, top_cone_right, top_cone_filler, ring_outer, ring_middle, ring_inner, ring_center

Text letters: letter_A, letter_M1, letter_M2, letter_A2

Next Steps:

You now have precise group IDs to target in JavaScript or CSS for your loading screen animation.
